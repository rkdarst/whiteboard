# Install mobwrite.  Default installion assumes it is in /mobwrite
wget <mobwrite_daemon>.zip
unzip <mobwrite_daemon>.zip

cp mobwrite/daemon/q.py .         # if updated
ln -s mobwrite/compressed_form.js .

ln -s htaccess .htaccess
ln -s q.py   q.py.mpy           # make it a mod_python script for speed
ln -s wb.py  wb.py.cgi          # make it a cgi script

The port needs to be configured in three places:
q.py ; rundaemon.py ; wb.py

The syncGateway needs to be adjusted in wb.py (leave it blank for the
default, q.py.mpy in the present directory)
