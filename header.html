Welcome to Richard's whiteboard thing.  To figure out what this does,
open the <a href="test.wb">test page</a> in several tabs at once, and
try editing in one tab.  Then check the other.<p>

<b>New pages</b>:
<ul>
<li><a href="wb.py.cgi?new=1">Random blank page</a>
<li><form action="wb.py.cgi" method="get">
    <input type="hidden" name="new" value="1">
    A page named:  
    <input type="text" name="prefix"> +"_" + (random postfix)
    <input type="submit" value="Go">
    </form>
<li><form action="wb.py.cgi" method="get">
    <input type="hidden" name="new" value="1">
    A page named exactly: 
    <input type="text" name="exactname">
    <input type="submit" value="Go">
    </form>
<li> Anything you want, you don't have to use these forms.
</ul>

<b>Usage notes:</b>
<ul>

<li>You can use any URL in this directory matching the pattern
"./XXXXXXXXX.wb", ( ./[a-zA-Z0-9._+=-]+\.wb , actually) and you get an
interactive whiteboard you can edit with multiple people.  

<li> Change the extension to ".txt" to get a static version.

<li>Permanence: *Not* guaranteed to be permanent.  However, it *is*
statically stored on the server, so will survive past reboots.  The
delete-time right now is set at one year, if you want it deleted
sooner, just erase all text.

<li>No edit history is kept, so note there is no long-term (or
short-term) guarantee here- anyone with your URL could erase your
work.  One workaround is to keep the static link open.  Null files and
files under 100 bytes may be deleted sooner.

<li>The data/ directory will never be publicly browseable - so if your
URL is secret, it is safe from all but the server admin.

</ul>

<b>About This Service:</b><p>

This service is run by <a href="http://rkd.zgib.net">Richard

enough and with a responsive person to help fix stuff.<p>

I certainly didn't do all of this myself, I just trivially hooked it
together.  See <a
